### Design Choices

##### Fonts
Considereing the target audience, the sans serif type of font is the more appropriate 
because is most often associated with simplicity and straightforwardness.  
I will be using:
* *Pacifico* for the name of the website (Family Friendy) only.
It is an handwriting type of font which is very friendly and welcoming 
with its roundness and has something fun to it that relate to the website.
* *Lato* and *Nunito* are used for the rest of the website. They both are 
sans serif type and they work very well together. They are comforting 
,simple and easy to ready. 

*Sans serif* will be use as a fall back if the fonts do not load. It is 
commun as the mains typography are sans serif type.

##### icons
* Some fontawesome icons will be part of the website for better UX.
* The [logo](assets/images/logo.png) and [favicon](assets/images/favicon.png) 
are the same image and use the color scheme of the website.

##### colors
The color scheme of the website is as follow:
* Yellow #E9F900 for Friendliness and Warmth,
* Blue #0845FF for Confidence, Sincerity and Integrity,
* Orange #FF8401 for Creativity and Innovation,
* Green #24C212 for Life, Growth and Nature.

The background will be off White #FAFAFA for simplicity and cleanliness.
Footer will be Grey #999999 for a nice contrast.

[Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-accessibility) was used 
to build the color compatibility and accessibility. The color scheme is said 
color blind safe.

##### images
Probably an hero image will be chossen only for the home page.  
No other images predicted. 

##### styling/feeling
The feel of the website is welcoming and simple (almost childish) to provide 
a quick access and learning process, make the users comfortable and make them want to try !

##### audio/video
No audio or video will be provided.
