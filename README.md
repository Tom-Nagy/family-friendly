#### Visit the live Website : **[Family Friendly :arrow_right:](WEBSITE LINK)**.

**Family Friendly** is a community based application where families can get together and have fun. This project promotes **togetherness**, **fun** and **community** through **activities**.  
It is difficult sometimes as new or experience parents to find the motivation to go out and do something with the hectic parenting life. You would have to organize something or think about going somewhere on top of preparing what you need to bring with you for your little one and for yourself. So you would consider doing nothing, stay put and deal with the craziness happening at home. A lot of different factors could amplify the sentiment.  
This can lead to inactivity, confinement and mental distress which only feed the vicious cycle.

In order to help parents and/or caretaker, I propose **Family Friendly**.  
This platform will propose features including a list of **events** coming up, the possibility to **create** and **join** event and access to **support** that provide useful *contacts* and *information*. As well a **forum** that allow users to share tips and help each other in a format of *Question* and *Answer*.

### Design Choices

#### Fonts

Considering the targeted audience, the sans serif type of font is the more appropriate because it is most often associated with simplicity and straightforwardness.  
I will be using:

* *Pacifico* for the name of the website (Family Friendly) only. It is a handwriting type of font which is very friendly and welcoming with its roundness and has something fun to it that relates to the website.

* *Lato* and *Nunito* are used for the rest of the website. They both are sans serif fonts, and they work very well together. They are comforting, simple and easy to ready.

*Sans serif* will be use as a fall back if the fonts do not load. It is common as the main typographies are sans serif type.

#### Icons

* Some Font Awesome icons will be part of the website for better UX.
* The [logo](assets/images/logo.png) and [favicon](assets/images/favicon.png) are the same image and use the color scheme of the website.

#### Colors

The colours chosen for the website are simple and joyful. They are based on the psychology behind colours ([colour affects](http://www.colour-affects.co.uk/psychological-properties-of-colours), [London Image Institute](https://londonimageinstitute.com/how-to-empower-yourself-with-color-psychology/)). I used Adobe Color to create the colour scheme.

* Yellow #E9F900 for Friendliness and Warmth.
* Blue #0845FF for Confidence, Sincerity and Integrity.
* Red #FF091E for cancelling and deleting functionality.
* Orange #FF8401 for Creativity and Innovation.
* Green #24C212 for Life, Growth and Nature.
* The background will be off White #FAFAFA for simplicity and cleanliness.
* Footer will be Grey #999999 for a nice contrast.

[Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-accessibility) was used to build the color compatibility and accessibility. The color scheme and swatches are said color-blind safe.

#### Images

The images will be the one uploaded by users for their profile, or images shared on the support channel.

#### Styling/Feeling

The feel of the website is welcoming and simple (almost childish) to provide a quick access and learning process, make users are comfortable and make them want to try !

#### Audio/Video

No audio or video will be integrated at the moment.
